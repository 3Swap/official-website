    'swap is a dex built on Binance smart chain that allows you to swap not one but two tokens for another across multiple chains with little or no fees. Asides from the flexibility and speed of swapping two tokens for one, 3Swap allows liquidity providers to earn more by giving an option to provide liquidity across three tokens. 3Swap is DeFi 1.0 renovated at the cost of nothing.'
