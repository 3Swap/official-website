    '3Swap is a decentralized exchange built on various EVM-Compatible chains that allows users to swap two tokens for one with little or no fees. Asides from the perk of swapping two tokens for one, 3Swap allows liquidity providers to earn more by allowing the provision of liquidity for three tokens.'
